## Meow! How does this work?

this is a fun and absolute pain of a language to use, but it was made for langjam!

I decided to follow the easel tutorial and changed some things up 

a lot of credit goes to jc and hack club!

the most noticeable of course is making it cat themed :3


### Defining a Variable

`meow x meoow 4` this creates the variable x 

there is no need to define variable types

it pretty simple think of `meow` as let in javascript

and think of `meoow` as an equal sign 

### Curly Brackets Got Changed >:)))

now you'll have to use `Meow` and `meoW` as left and right curly brackets respectively

### Print

`grrr("meow")`

### Random

`randmeow(min, max)`

returns an int that includes the min and max

### Conditionals 

example code: 

```
meow x meoow randmeow(0,2)

mrow (x == 0) Meow
    grrr("meow?")
meoW mroow (x == 1) Meow
    grrr("meow!")
meoW mroooww Meow
    grrr("meow")
meoW
```

here you can see the start of how weird this language looks like

the basic gist is: 

|  keyword| function |
| -----: | ----- |
|  mrow   | if|
|   mroow  | if else|
|  mroooww   | else|
